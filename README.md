# MultiStack, Spring 2016
This is a project for my Spring 2016 Data Structures and Algorithms class. It implements multiple generic stacks in a certain amount of space, and rearranges them in this space when they grow big enough to interfere with each other.

The majority of this lab is implementing the Stack Reallocation Algorithm.

A complete description of the assignment is available in DSMultiStackLabDescription.pdf

There were multiple options for different grades, I implemented the 'A' option.

multigstack.ads is the specification for the generic multiple stacks.

multigstack.adb is the implementation for the generic multiple stacks.

multigstackdriver.adb is the specific implementation using multigstack to preform the required operations for the lab.

The input and output files are the inputs and outputs for the specific data sets given by the professor to test the program.
